sk89q-command-framework
=======================

**NOTE**: This repository is no longer maintained, but a [second iteration](https://github.com/Electroid/intake) of this framework is still active.

sk89q-command-framework is the command framework from sk89q's WorldEdit. It has been factored out so it may be used in other projects without having to include WorldEdit as a dependency.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed, simply run:

    mvn clean install

Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work, be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
